// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

set var for num 1 = x
set var for num 2 = y
set var for sum = z
x + y == z

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

set var for user input = input
input % 2 = r
if rr == 0 print even
else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

set var for num 1 = a 
set var for num 2 = b
set var for num 3 = c
set var for num 4 = d
set var for num 5 = e
ask user for inputs

FIND AVG 
a + b + c + d + e = sum
sum/5 == avg
print avg

FIND SMALL AND LARGE
set var for large = big
if a > b        a==big
else	 	b==big
if c > big      c== big
if d > big      d==big
if e > big      e==big

set var for small = small
if a < b        a==small
else            b==small
if c < small    c==small
if d < small    d==small
if e < small    e==small

print big. This is the largest number you entered. I compared the first two numbers and found the largest of the two. Then I compared each number afterward to find the largest. 
print small. This is the smallest number you entered. I compared the first two numbers and found the smallest of the two. Then I compared each number afterward to find the smallest
